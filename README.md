## Requirements

- iOS 13
- Swift 5.5

### File structure and naming conventions

File structure and component names reflect the Orbit design system structure.

As some Orbit components already exist in standard SwiftUI library (for example a `Text` component), Orbit components will shadow them. In order to access standard component, a `SwifUI.` prefix can be used.
